Employee Service
The Employee Service application allows you to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, and Delete) operations on employee records. It leverages PostgreSQL for database storage and RabbitMQ for event handling.

Getting Started
To run the application, follow these steps:

Start PostgreSQL and RabbitMQ using Docker Compose:

`docker-compose up -d`

Run the Employee Service application.

The application will initialize with two pre-existing employee records in the database.
